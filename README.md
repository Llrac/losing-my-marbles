The smartphone controller is hooked up to the main game via Firebase. The main game will generate a random code that the player will have to input to access the game (sort of like Jackbox). Once all players have logged in the game begins. The players have 30 seconds to program their movement by choosing from their alloted marbles. If they run out of time the remaining slots will be filled at random. The player order is determined chronologically (ie the player who comitted their orders first are the one who'll go first etc).
